## Development environment

### node

There are several ways to get a node environment. Method described here uses **nodeenv**

See [Configuration Reference](https://github.com/ekalinin/nodeenv).

### Installing nodeenv

*nodeenv* is a Python package similar to *virtualenv*

```sh
# Install nodeenv. You may need root permission.
pip install nodeenv

# At this writing, node 8.x is the long term support, so it is the recommended version to use.
# To see a list of available node versions.
nodeenv --list

# Create your node virtual environment.
nodeenv --node=8.16.0 env-project-name

# Activate your environment
source env-project-name/bin/activate
```

### Project setup

#### Clone project

Clone the repository to your desired project name.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/crcresearch/vuetify-cc.git project-name-vuetify-cc
```

#### New GitHub repo.

Create a new, empty GitHub repo for your new project.

#### Delete '.git' from current vcc

This step allows you to switch the source of your repository to your new project repository.

```sh
cd project-name-vuetify-cc

git init

# Follow instructions to add a new repository.
```

https://github.com/euvl/vue-notification/

### Usage

```js
  this.$notify({
    title: 'Important message',
    text: 'Hello user! This is a notification!',
    duration: 10000,
    type: 'error|success|warn|info'
  });
```

**NOTE: Type can be 'success' (green), 'warn' (yellow), 'error' (red), or just left blank (blue)***

## Extra CSS

BVCC is Bootstrap + VueJS. By design (bootstrap-vue), all elements and css available in Bootstrap CSS are also available to you in BVCC. All the CSS packages listed below are available to you out of the box in BVCC.

### Bootstrap

Currently using v4.x

https://getbootstrap.com/

### Fontawesome

If you want to use fancy icons, use fontawesome. 

https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free

### Tailwind

For fine grained css work, use utility library tailwind CSS. 

https://tailwindcss.com/

**NOTE: Because of conflicts, tailwind has been namespaced. Use 'tw-' for any tailwind classes you want to use in BVCC.**
